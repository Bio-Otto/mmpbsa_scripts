 Please download and install Amber20. At the end, you should have a path to amber and set the environment variable:
 ```
export AMBERHOME=/Users/austin/Downloads/amber20
```
where inside the folder there is a file ```amber.sh```.


 
Create a new Conda env with python 3.7 and install the following packages below.
```
conda create -n myenv python=3.7 -y
conda activate myenv
conda install -c conda-forge -c omnia -c openeye openmm openeye-toolkits pymbar parmed ambertools
``` 


### Usage
There will be more features added in the future. For now, this is the code on the master branch. 

Please make sure your working directory is the base of this repo.

```
cd path-to-mmgbsa_scripts/
```

There are two phases to MMGBSA/PBSA calculations: equilibration (or relaxation as I think of it), and the production simulation
where we sample states to use for the MMGBSA calculation. MMGBSA calculations are computed on static frames, and averaed over those frames.
There are two approaches implemented. ```--calcFrames 5``` for example will sample five equally spaced frames from the production 
trajectories (this is the naive approach), ```--mbar 100``` for example will sample 100 equall spaced frames, and then use a technique
from John Chodera's lab to subsample those frames to "maximizes number of effectively uncorrelated samples" [1].  For instance,
```--mbar 100``` will sample 100 frames, and then subsample 20 frames that are the least correlated. By default, the code will use 
```--mbar``` instead of naive sampling. The default settings should be perfect for most cases. 


Here is an example. You can use -h to see more options if desired. 
PBSA is very slow. If you use ```--method pbsa``` please also do not use ```--mbar```, instead pass ```--calcFrames ``` with a number
no greater than 10 unless you have a lot of time on your hands... 

```
export AMBERHOME=...../amber20
export OE_LICENSE=...../oe_license.txt
source $AMBERHOME/amber.sh
conda activate myenv #do this after the source.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run_mmgpbsa.py --pdb /homes/aclyde/MPro_0387_Gen3L_5.pdb -v 0 \ 
               --odir testdir --platform CUDA
```

If the script is being wonky, try passing ```--amber_path $AMBERHOME```, though it should automatically detect this from the env.
